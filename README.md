Phone Home
==========

Phone Home is a choose-your-own-adventure game written by [Jen Costa](https://twitter.com/teamstersub) and me, with artwork by [Noreen Rana](https://twitter.com/neomonki).

Phone Home was created using [Twine](http://www.gimcrackd.com/etc/src/) and a little JavaScript.

The game is inspired by Jen's *actual* conversations with her mother. The object of the game is to successfully navigate a phone call with your mother.
